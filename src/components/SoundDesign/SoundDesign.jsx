            <p>Since the early 2000’s, I’ve been an editor, technical director and show director for national radio shows, including The Takeaway (WNYC/PRX), Freakonomics Radio, and The Randi Rhodes Show on Air America Radio. I’ve honed my skill at sound design, producing thousands of pre-produced intros, bits, montages and more based around breaking news, as well as entertainment/culture, and a gallimaufry of strange and random audio experiments. I’ve also sound designed theatrical off-broadway plays, and mixed sound for films.</p>
