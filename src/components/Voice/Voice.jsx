            <p>I’ve had opportunities throughout my career to step out from behind the glass, and I’m equally as comfortable talking into the mic and making sounds. My voicework includes national and local radio promos, funders, advertisements, translation voiceovers, and show liners.</p>

            <p>I also do voice over work for video games, some of which should be available very soon. I can do characters, or any kind of tone you may need.</p>
